## Project 8: Integrating genomics and high-frequency physiologic data for sepsis detection

Combining genomics data with physiologic read-outs may be effective in creating robust machine learning and data analysis pipeline. The example microarray gene expression data can be downloaded from:

* GEO [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/] and
* physiologic data from eICU [https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/]
