## Integrating genomics and physiologic (high-frequency) data to enhance early sepsis identification 
Improved risk stratification and prognosis in sepsis is a critical unmet need. Recent researches on developing predictive models for sepsis prognosis prediction suggest that major challenge to accuracy is due to substantial patient heterogeneity in the sepsis syndrome and a lack of tools to accurately categorize sepsis at the molecular level. 

We believe combining genomics data with physiologic read-outs may be effective in creating robust machine learning and data analysis pipeline. And, this can be effectively useful to develope highly accurate predictive model for sepsis prognonsis.
